# awcWideoBot
a discord bot to search and grab wideo url's from a playlist.

This is a very simple wrapper around a bot written by @asottile. It fuzzyfinds and retrieves a video from a playlist, if not found just returns the playlist to the asker.
In the processs of translating this from a one use case to a general solution for anyone with a youtube channel and a playlist to use.
